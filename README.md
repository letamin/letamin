- 👋 Hi, I’m @letamin. Nice to meet you!
I'm currently 26 and I'm from Vietnam.  
In 2018, I graduated from Vietnamese-German university with Bachelor degree in Computer Science.  
From 2018-2020, I worked as a SAP technical consultant for Robert Bosch Engineering Vietnam.  
From 2020 until now, I am working as a Software Engineer at Go2Joy Vietnam.  

- 👀 I’m interested in:    
Learning new things: Although I'm a little bit lazy but I'm trying to pick up some books here and there to expand my knowledge. Astronomy, technology and science-fiction are my favorite genre.  
Doing exercies: A good mind is great, but a good mind plus a good body is even more awesome. Running and swimming are parts of my weekend with family.  

- 🌱 I’m currently learning:  
More in-depth about one of the most popular programming languages: Javascript.  
Vuejs and its eco-system: vuex/router/test utils/dev tools,... and so on.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything. I'm trying to improve myself everyday.
